## Environments

### UV

#### How to install

- definition : module for managing project ! (better than pip, pyenv, poetry, virtualenv ...)
- [How to install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)

#### How to use

- Initialize a project

```batch
cd {directory}

REM Create a folder named prj_name, and init uv under the folder
uv init {prj_name} 

REM init uv at current folder
uv init 
```

- Fetch and setup other project dependencies

```batch
REM Copy pyproject.toml file into your project folder
REM And then,
uv sync # at the folder
```

- Add new package without pyproject.toml

```batch
uv add {package_name}
```

> **uv.lock File**
> - After setting up dependencies with `add` or `sync`, There might be a a file named uv.lock. And the file is designed to let system know the sub-dependencies of the main dependencies which are specidifed under pyproject.toml


### Jupyter

#### How to install

1. Install jupyter extension in vscode
2. Install ipykernel python module using `uv`

    ```batch
    REM --dev argumnet is to install the module only for developer
    uv add ipykernel --dev
    ```

#### How to use

1. Create `.ipynb` file with main or with other name.
2. Select `venv` which is created by uv

## OpenAI Billing

- [OpenAI billing page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization)
- $30-$50 might be enough to move forward

## Set up project

1. Create folder
2. Initialize uv

    ```batch
    uv init
    ```

3. Copy `pyproject.toml` if it is provided.
4. Synchronize current project's dependencies with dipendencies which are specified pyproject.toml 

    - [Troubleshooting a case - OS error 396 when using OneDrive](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/7906)

    ```batch
    uv sync REM if not in Onedrive

    REM If you're using OneDrive of Windows
    REM 1. Not use hardlink
    uv sync --link-mode=copy # do not use hardlink 
    
    REM 2. Clean cache and do sync
    uv cache clean
    uv sync
    ```

5. Set vscode's venv to uv's venv
6. Create `.env file` and add OPENAI_API_KEY (you can use any other name as env variable)

    ```python
    os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY") # it will return the key
    ```


## Build your first AI response

- [a list of model that gpt need to be fed](https://platform.openai.com/docs/pricing)

- How to get response from `the selected model` by using `openai module`

```python
import openai
client = openai.OpenAI()

# Arguments
# - model : go to prcing page, and then choose one of the models
# - messages : a list of dict need to be fed into this argument
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    messages=[
        {
            "role" : "user",
            "content" : "How to build usd asset assembly in houdini ?",
        }
    ]
)

# Following that, just retrieve message from choice object
choice = response.choices[0]
choice.message.content
```

## AI Agent ! what is that ?

- Definition : A system that handle with question or problem on behalf of user
- And, AI Agent is an AI, when user asks 
    
    - ```python
        """
        I have the following functions in my system.

        `get_weather`
        `get_currency`
        `get_news`

        All of them receive the name of a country as an argument (i.e get_news('spain'))

        Please answer with the name of the function that you would like me to run.

        Please say nothing else, just the name of the function with the arguments.

        Answer the following question:

        What is the weather in Greece ?
        """
        ```
- not ask
    - ```python
    """
    How to get a weather in Greece by using functions below ?
        `get_weather`
        `get_currency`
        `get_news`
    """
    ```

- if so, it returns 
    - ![answer01](/assets/AIAgent/what_is_aiAgent_01.png)
    - instead of 
    - ```
    "To get the weather in Greece using a hypothetical `get_weather` function, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check Parameters Required**: Understand what parameters the `get_weather` function accepts. Common parameters might include the location (in this case, Greece), the date for which you want the weather, and perhaps the type of data you need (current weather, forecast, etc.).\n\n2. **Call the Function**: Use the `get_weather` function with the appropriate arguments.\n\nHereâ€™s a simple example in Python (assuming these functions are provided in a package or module):\n\n```python\n# Example of fetching weather in Greece\n\n# Assume these functions are defined in a module named 'weather_api'\nfrom weather_api import get_weather\n\n# Get current weather in Greece\ngreece_weather = get_weather(location='Greece')\n\n# Output the weather\nprint(greece_weather)\n```\n\n### Example Output\nThe output might be a dictionary or an object with weather details such as temperature, humidity, condition (sunny, rainy, etc.).\n\n### Additional Options\nIf you want to retrieve related information, you could also use the `get_currency` and `get_news` functions in a similar manner:\n\n```python\n# Example of fetching currency and news related to Greece\n\n# Get the currency information\nfrom finance_api import get_currency\n\ngreece_currency = get_currency(country='Greece')\nprint(greece_currency)\n\n# Get news related to Greece\nfrom news_api import get_news\n\ngreece_news = get_news(topic='Greece')\nprint(greece_news)\n```\n\n### Summary\n- Use `get_weather` to fetch weather data for Greece.\n- Use `get_currency` to fetch currency details (like the Euro).\n- Use `get_news` to get the latest news related to Greece.\n\nBe sure to check the documentation for the specific API or library you're using to understand the exact function signatures and available parameters!"
    ```
- `Prompt` is really important !

## Adding memory
- Problem ! : With the code above - [Build your first AI response](#build-your-first-ai-response), it will not remember user's previous question like
    - ```text
    user : My name is Taiyeong
    AI : Hi Taiyeong, what can I help you?
    user : what is my name
    AI : Sorry...
    ```
