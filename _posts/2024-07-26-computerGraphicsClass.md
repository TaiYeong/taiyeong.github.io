# üß† Kernel and Convolution

- [Kernel-wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing))
- [Convolution-wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution)

## Kernal

### üóÇÔ∏è Core Concepts

- **Kernel (Convolution matrix / Mask)**: A small matrix used for transformations like *blurring*, *sharpening*, *embossing*, and *edge detection*.
- **Convolution**: Mathematical operation where each output pixel is computed using a weighted sum of nearby input pixels using the kernel.

### üîç Kernel Operation

- **Origin**: The conceptual reference point in the kernel that aligns with the output pixel during convolution.
- **Symmetric Kernels**: Often use the center element as origin.
- **Flipping**: Non-symmetric kernels must be flipped both horizontally and vertically before applying convolution.

### üìê Edge Handling Techniques

- `Extend`: Repeats border pixels outward.
- `Wrap`: Uses pixels from opposite edges (like tiling).
- `Mirror`: Reflects pixels at the image edge.
- `Crop / Avoid overlap`: Skips edge pixels ‚Äî used frequently in **machine learning** pipelines (e.g., shrinking a 32√ó32 image to 23√ó23).
- `Constant`: Fills outside areas with fixed values (black/gray).

### üßÆ Normalization

- Scales kernel values so their sum equals **unity (1)**.
- Maintains overall image brightness post-processing.

### ‚ö° Optimization ‚Äì *Separable Convolution*

- A 2D convolution (M√óN kernel) typically needs **M√óN multiplications per pixel**.
- If the kernel is **separable**, computation drops to **M+N**, by applying two 1D convolutions.

### üñ•Ô∏è GPU Implementation Highlights

- GLSL shader code demonstrates how to:
  - Extract a 3√ó3 region from texture
  - Apply convolution with various kernels (`edge0`, `sharpen`, `gaussian_blur`)
  - Process individual color channels (RGB)
  - Use functions like `matrixCompMult` for element-wise operations

## Convolution

### üóÇÔ∏è Core Concepts

- **Convolution**: An operation that combines two functions by integrating the product of one function with a shifted and flipped version of the other.
- **Notation**: $$(f * g)(t) \;=\; \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(\tau)\,g(t-\tau)\,d\tau$$
- **Graphical Meaning**: Represents how the shape of one function modifies another.

### üîÅ Properties

- **Commutative**:  $f * g = g * f$
- **Associative**:  $f * (g * h) = (f * g) * h$
- **Distributive**: $f * (g + h) = f * g + f * h$
- **Translation Equivariance**: Convolution commutes with shifts in input

### üìê Variants

- **Discrete Convolution**: For integer-indexed sequences (used in signal & image processing).
- **Circular Convolution**: Convolution over periodic domains or in FFT-based processing.
- **Infimal Convolution**: Used in convex analysis and optimization.

### üßÆ Mathematical Relations

- **Convolution Theorem**: Fourier transform of convolution is the product of individual transforms.
  - $ \mathcal{F}(f * g) = \mathcal{F}(f) \cdot \mathcal{F}(g) $
- **Laplace Transform & Z-transform equivalents**
- **Convolution with delta function** results in the original function

### üöÄ Applications

- **Signal & Image Processing**: Filtering, edge detection, blurring, sharpening
- **Machine Learning / CNNs**: Feature extraction via convolution layers
- **Probability**: Distribution of sum of two independent random variables
- **Physics / Spectroscopy**: Combining different response functions (e.g. Voigt profile)
