## Docker Basic
### Why do we learn 'Docker' ?
- portability : 이식성 : 
    - It allow users to install or implement target(SW) in any dev enviroment


### Terminology
- **IP / Port**
    - *Every machine has their own address. and in there, eache software has their own room number. so address:port (127.0.0.1:3000) is the example of it.*
    - IP : address of machine (computer)
    - Port : exact software's room number
        - additional info 
            - default port = 80
            - 20 : SSH / 80 : HTTP / 443 : HTTPS

- **Container / Image**
    - container : mini-computer 
    - image : game pack
