## Project Setup - venv
- Why to use : 
    - to install modules independently
    - to manage modules independently
- How
    - `setup` virtual environment
        
        ```
        python -m venv venv
        ```

    - `activate` virtual environment

        ```
        # In Windows 
        venv\Scripts\activate

        # In Mac or Linux
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    
    - `manage` modules

        ```
        # install
        pip install {module_name}

        # check the list of modules
        pip list

        # get the list within txt file
        pip freeze > requirements.txt

        # install module list using txt file
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    - `deactivate` virtunal environment

        ```
        deactivate
        ```


## Absolute Import vs Relative Import

- Two terms are for where does code start to track 
- Absolute Import
    - start from `root directory` of project
- Relative Import
    - start from `current script file`
- `In python2`, there was a confliction issue between original module name and created module name. So for the sake of avoiding the confliction, need to use `from __future__ import absolute_import`
- `In python3`, this condition or setup become default, so this is `not necessary`

## Module

### \_\_future\_\_

#### Deferred evaluation by storing module as string

    ```python
    from __future__ import annotations
    ```
