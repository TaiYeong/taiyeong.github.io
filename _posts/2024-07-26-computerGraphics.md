## Math

### Deviation (편차)
- Definition : this is a expression that represent how much something is far from baseline / average.

### Perpendicular & Cross section
- ex) between the unit vector perpendicular to the cross section and the tangent to the centre line
- Explanation :
    ```

  |    ●------|-----> 중심선의 접선 벡터
  |           |       (Tangent to the centre line)
  |           |

  단면에 수직인 단위 벡터
(Unit vector perpendicular to the cross section)

    ```

### Perpendicular & Orthogonal
- Definition : they are same meaning. 90 &deg;
- Comparision : 
    - Perpendicular : normally used in Geometry
    - Orthogonal : normally used in lineary algebra (vector space)
- Use case:
    - Orthonormal : this is a relationship between two vectors. so if the two vector

### Surface normal
- 


### Frenet-Serret formula
- Definition : this is a formula that represent how exact point (particle) move along curve using Normal (N) / Tangent (T) / Bii-normal (B)
- Use case
    - because it isn't for represent one object, it isn't good to be used in calculating object stuff.
    - it is good for calculating movement of point
    - but we can use N / T / B concept in context of how object is moved in terms of orientation.

### Vector Dot & Cross product (Meaning)

### Vector projection
    - need to check if it is used in calculating orientation between two meshes

### barycentric interpolation
